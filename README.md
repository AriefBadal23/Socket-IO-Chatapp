# My Socket.IO chatapp

## What is it?
This is a simple Socket.io chatapplication to simply chat with other users.
Its not something new or innovative but only for learning purposes.
I will use Python to create the application with the Socket.IO library for Python

In the folder documentation there is a file named **"Design_chatapp.png"** there you can see the overall design I want to use to create the app
